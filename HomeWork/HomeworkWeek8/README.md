# Software Engineering

- **Planning:** Determining the objectives of the software project, allocating resources, and creating the project plan.

- **Analysis:** Understanding, determining, and documenting customer requirements.

- **Design:** Creating the architecture of the software, designing subsystems, and components.

- **Development:** Coding, integrating, and testing the designed software.

- **Maintenance:** Rectifying errors, making improvements, and ensuring updates during software usage.
